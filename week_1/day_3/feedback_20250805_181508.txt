suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, using `zip` would be more Pythonic and efficient than a for loop.  The provided solution works correctly, but `zip` is a more concise and idiomatic approach aligned with the exercise's suggestion.
- In Exercise 2, you could improve readability by using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `total_cost` instead of `price`).
- In Exercise 3, the code correctly addresses all aspects of the task but could benefit from some minor formatting enhancements for better readability (e.g., consistent indentation, spacing around operators).
- In Exercise 4, while functional, the use of three separate loops to create the dictionaries is not the most efficient approach.  Consider exploring dictionary comprehensions for creating `dict_1` and `dict_2`, and a more integrated approach for `dict_3` that combines sorting with dictionary construction.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately and completely addresses all four exercises.  Each exercise directly implements the functionality described in the corresponding section of the Chapter Content/Questions.  All expected outputs are produced correctly.
- readability: The code is generally readable, but some minor improvements in variable naming and code structuring would enhance readability.  The use of descriptive variable names and consistent formatting would further improve this aspect. For instance, `my_dict`, `dict_1`, `dict_2`, and `dict_3` are not very descriptive.
- performance: The code's performance is acceptable for the given tasks.  There are no obvious performance bottlenecks. For larger datasets, using more efficient data structures or algorithms (such as `zip` for dictionary creation) could enhance performance. The current performance is adequate for these relatively small example datasets.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in the code.
