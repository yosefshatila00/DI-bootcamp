This move was not done by someone's gut feeling it was done by sophisticated data analysis of customer behavior and market trends.\n","# The data analyzed was\n","# •\tTransactional Data: Sales data from its physical stores and website, specifically focusing on DVD sales and rental patterns.\n","# •\tCustomer Behavior Data: Data on its DVD-by-mail subscription service customers. This included rental frequency, title preferences, churn rate (cancellation rate), and customer demographics.\n","# •\tMarket Trend Data: Industry data on the rapid growth of video streaming subscriptions, the declining sales of physical DVDs, and the skyrocketing market valuation and subscriber growth of Netflix.\n","# •\tOperational Data: The costs of running its mail-order logistics network—inventory, shipping, processing returns—compared to the revenue per user.\n","#   methods used are\n","# •\tTrend Analysis and Forecasting: Analysts projected the future revenue curves of both physical DVD rentals and streaming. The data clearly showed a steep, irreversible decline for physical media.\n","# •\tCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis: Walmart calculated the projected revenue it could expect from a DVD rental customer over time. This was compared against the high cost of acquiring and servicing that customer. The analysis revealed that CLV was decreasing rapidly.\n","# •\tCompetitive Analysis: By benchmarking its own service against Netflix, Walmart's data showed it was not winning the race. Netflix had a larger library, a more sophisticated recommendation engine, and was already successfully pivoting its resources from mailing discs to streaming content.\n","# The outcome of this strategy is Cut losses on an unprofitable venture or a slowly dying venture. had a huge capital gain rather than spending a lot of money on building a new streaming platform. If Walmart did not use data analysis the executives might have decided to double down on the rental business to win against Netflix, wasting billions of dollars on a physical media distribution network that would have been a huge loss.\n","\n"]}]}
